# Research Question: 

In this project, I demonstrate the essential skills involved in hypothesis testing. To do so, I have used a dataset that stems from a replication attempt of published research (Wallisch & Whritner,2017). To run the tests,I set the per-test significance level ùõº to 0.005 (as per Benjamin et al., 2018). Throughout the project KS-test, T-test, Mann-Whitney, and a few other significance tests were performed depending on the question at hand.

# Data:

This dataset features ratings data of 400 movies from 1097 research participants.  A brief description of the data is as follows:

  1st row: Headers (Movie titles/questions) ‚Äì note that the indexing in this list is from 1 <br>
  Row 2-1098: Responses from individual participants <br>
  Columns 1-400: These columns contain the ratings for the 400 movies (0 to 4, and missing) <br>
  Columns 401-421: These columns contain self-assessments on sensation seeking behaviors (1-5) <br>
  Columns 422-464: These columns contain responses to personality questions (1-5) <br>
  Columns 465-474: These columns contain self-reported movie experience ratings (1-5) <br>
  Column 475: Gender identity (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = self-described) <br>
  Column 476: Only child (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response) <br>
